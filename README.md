A little project build with angular to display multiple videos from YouTube in a grid view. This projects uses angular material and angular YouTube player to display the videos.

There are two grid modes available:

- Free grid: where all added videos are displayed with the same size in a grid view
- 2+3 grid: where are 2 videos in a bigger size and another row with 3 more videos with smaller sizes.

Each grid has the possibility to save the current videos in browser local storage.
