A little project build with angular to display multiple videos from YouTube in a grid view. This projects uses angular material and angular YouTube player to display the videos.

There are two grid modes available:

- Free grid: where all added videos are displayed with the same size in a grid view
- 2+3 grid: where are 2 videos in a bigger size and another row with 3 more videos with smaller sizes.

Each grid has the possibility to save the current videos in browser local storage.


The docs folder contains the compiled website to be deployed in GitHub pages.
